- 👋 Hi, I’m @eriklarsen4
- 👀 I’m interested in baseball informatics and research and bioinformatics. I'll be updating a large bulk of all the uploaded content soon.
- 🌱 My doctoral work involved calcium imaging processing and analysis, RNAseq, IPMS, WGCNA, GO and pathway analysis around a protein involved in axon degeneration/neurodegeneration. I enjoy analyzing baseball datasets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting- biology or baseball.
