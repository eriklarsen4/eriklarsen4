- 👋 Hi, I’m @eriklarsen4
- 👀 I started in baseball: I played Division-I in college. I transitioned to biology/physiology/neuroscience and got into bioinformatics. So, my interests are baseball informatics/research and bioinformatics. I'll be updating and expanding on my uploaded content soon.
- 🌱 My doctoral work involved calcium imaging processing and statistical analysis, RNA-seq, IPMS, WGCNA, and GO and pathway analysis. All of this was around a protein involved in axon degeneration/neurodegeneration. I enjoy analyzing baseball datasets with ML and statistical modeling techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting- biology or baseball.
- 📫 How to reach me: erik_larsen4@yahoo.com
